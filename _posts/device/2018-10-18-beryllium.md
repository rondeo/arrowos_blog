Hello there this is Ganesh Varma, your Pocophone F1 device maintainer for ArrowOS. I'll be interacting with you guys over here in the comments section regarding any device specific queries and also will be sharing a few tweaks/tricks/mods that i use on the device. With no doubt Poco F1 has been really great device done by Xiaomi soo far and am really pleased with their concern and support towards the custom rom community.

### My homescreen setup:

  - I'm more of a simple guy and use a custom launcher called "Lawnchair" which is really clean with the right amount of customisations just like our rom.
  - The icon pack used here is called "Delta icon pack" with really simple and flat icons.
  - Wallpaper [grab it here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V6awbE511gjZxJqShsqgKhNNtrg_Tx8S)
  - Lawnchair config backup [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B8Zq6UryGWh_J3ONPIko_44BSya1EkC6)

### Mods:
I'm more into rooting and can't get past a day without mods. I use magisk for root and most of it's good modules.<br>
#### Here are a few of the mods that i use:
  - Google sans font
  - Lawnstep
  - Youtube vanced black themed

#### Substratum themes:
  - Swift black
  - Flux
